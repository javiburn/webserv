		<h2>About Geckos</h2>
		<p>
			Geckos are a type of lizard found in warm climates throughout the
			world. They range from 1.6 cm to 60 cm. Geckos are unique among
			lizards in their vocalizations, making chirping sounds in social
			interactions with other geckos.
		</p>
		<h2>Gecko Lifestyle</h2>
		<p>
			Geckos are mostly small, usually nocturnal reptiles with a soft
			skin. They also possess a short stout body, a large head, and
			typically well-developed limbs. Many species are well known for
			their specialized toe pads that enable them to climb smooth and
			vertical surfaces, and even cross indoor ceilings with ease.
		</p>
		<h2>Gecko History</h2>
		<p>
			Geckos are believed to be the first lizards to vocalize, and some
			species can emit a variety of high-pitched sounds, including barks,
			chirps and clicks. Fossil evidence from the Middle East suggests
			geckos have been around for at least 100 million years, and they
			were likely the first lizards to make vocal sounds.
