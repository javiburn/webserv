# Webserv

This project is about writing your own HTTP server.

Being able to understand how the HTTP protocol works is a fundamental skill for web developers. This project will help you understand what happens when you type an address into your browser and press enter.

# Program

## Initial installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magnitopic/webserv.git
cd webserv
make
```

## Compilation and execution

The program take's a configuration file as argument. If none is provided the default configuration file is `./webserv.conf`.

```bash
./webserv [config_file]
```

## Configuration file

The configuration file is a simple text file that contains the server's configuration. It is composed of a series of blocks, each one representing a server. Each block is composed of a series of directives.

_A few examples of configuration files can be found in the root of the repository._

# Stress test

You can test the servers performance by running the `siege` command. This command will send a series of requests to the server and measure the time it takes to respond.

```bash
siege -b http://localhost:8080
```

# Open ports

The server will open a socket for every port specified in the configuration file.
You can check it has correctly opened the ports by running the example script `open_ports.sh`:

> **_NOTE:_** This script only checks ports `8080` and `8082`. You can add your own ports to the script.

```bash
./open_ports.sh
```

# Pages directory

The pages directory of the repository contains a few example pages that can be served by the server. You can add your own pages to this directory and access them through the server.
